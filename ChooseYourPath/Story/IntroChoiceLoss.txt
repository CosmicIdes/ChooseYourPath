You climb into your car and turn your back on the sign, driving down the gravel path that you surely followed into this place. 

Surely you did. 

And surely, as you drive down this winding gravel road through tightly packed trees with branches that slap your windshield and animals that you perceive only as darting, furtive movement, you will eventually reach a main road. A paved, smooth, road. 

Surely you will. 
Surely, right around this corner.

Well, maybe the next turn. 

Up over this hill. 

Eventually youâ€™ll be home, wherever that is, or was. 

Surely. 

END
