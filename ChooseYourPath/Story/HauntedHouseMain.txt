You’re not sure how anything in this place could be more haunted than the park itself, but you head off for the “Haunted House” marked on the map. 

What you find isn’t really a house–it’s a large metal box that looks like it could be easily folded up and hauled off by a truck to a carnival in the next state–or at least it once could have been. Rust and years and the woods have seeped into its cracks, and if someone attempted to fold it up and cart it away it wouldn’t survive the first pothole it encountered on its way out of the park. 

The metal structure is gaudily painted with faux stonework, cartoon skeletons peeking from around corners and through barred windows. The fading of years hasn’t diminished this old ride’s charm, and it’s a surprisingly welcome sight, a carnival staple planted amongst these claustrophobic hills. 

And, right at the entrance, an old, old man with hair the color of yellowed receipts waves cheerfully at you. “Step right up, step right up! Have the fright of your life!” His face is so wrinkled it looks like melted wax, and on his polo shirt is a name tag that reads “Gene.” He really seems quite nice, and enthusiastic to get you on this old ride. 

Will you ride the Haunted House?
