You step through the wooden gate onto the hard packed dirt. You kick up dust as you walk towards the bright white enclosure. When you touch the door to step inside, it is skin-warm, like the enclosure itself has blood pumping just beneath the fresh coats of paint. 

Inside is filled with sweet-smelling clean hay. A single animal is curled up atop the hay, a small brown fawn with bright white spots. You’ve woken it up. It lifts its head to gaze at you and bleats a greeting—or is it a question? 

Yes, it’s a question. 

You fall to your knees as the words of a god fill your brain. 

HAVE YOU AN OFFERING, OR HAVE YOU DISTURBED MY SLUMBER WITHOUT REASON?

An offering? All you have on you is the caramel corn! Will that be enough?

Will you offer the Deer God your caramel corn?
