You step forward under the sign and Hill Cavern Fair opens up to you amidst the woods. You first notice the darkness of the park–you’ve never seen a theme park so shaded by trees and hills. You would expect from the name that you would be on a hill, or maybe there would be a cave nearby? but you see no indication of either. 

In fact, the park seems surrounded by hills, set in the lowest places among them. The path is now paved, but it was paved long ago, and is beset with potholes and weeds. A small turnstile blocks your way, and this is surely where your exploration will be stopped, because there is no way this place is open. Your car was the only one in the parking lot, and nothing here seems maintained. 

“It’s free today,” a cracked, aged voice says, from your left, while you were looking right.

You jump and turn. A man stands beside you, in a faded polo shirt. He is unbelievably old, bent by the weight of years and overwhelmingly the color of yellowed receipts, from his tar-stained teeth to his liver-spotted skin. A name tag on his chest says “Eugene.” 

You don’t have a chance to ask for more information as he thrusts a ticket and a park map in your hand and gestures to the turnstile. “Free on Tuesdays.”

Is it Tuesday? You don’t think so. 

The turnstile creaks loudly as you enter Hill Cavern Fair.
