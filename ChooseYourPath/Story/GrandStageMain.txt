The Grand Stage appears to be neither grand, nor a stage. 

What you find in the place marked on the map is a small outdoor amphitheater of the kind often found in small parks: three levels of concrete seating set into a hill with a flat paved area in the center that it would be rather generous to term a “stage”. The woods are encroaching more into this area than any of the others: there are vine-choked trees on all sides of the paved area, and cracks in the concrete as it continues to lose the fight against the roots of those trees. The vines hang down into the space, and various plants are sprouting from the cracks. Piles of years of leaves and other rotting plant matter line the edges of the concrete. 

This seems more to be a small rest area than an attraction, but sure enough there is a sign amid the weeds on the stage that seems to indicate a performance will occur here in five minutes. 

Will you stay for the performance?
