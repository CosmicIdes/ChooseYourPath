How did you get here? Your memory is fuzzy and ill-formed, and it makes you sick to your stomach every time you try to focus on it. You’re standing beside your car, in an empty gravel-covered parking lot surrounded by woods. Green encroaches on all sides, vines and grass and burrs reaching past the barriers around the parking lot and towards you and your car. 

Before you an is an archway topped by a rusted and faded metal sign bearing the words 

#     #                     #####                                        #######

The vines don’t touch this archway, rickety and ill-maintained as it is. 

You have a choice to make, here. 

Both choices make you feel bad, but different kinds of bad. 

The idea of going forward into this place fills you with dread: the dread of looking over edge of a very tall cliff and considering the bottom, the dread of having to admit to your boss that you’ve made an error that you know isn’t correctable, the dread of many, many potential bad futures and a handful of good ones. 

On the other hand, getting in your car and driving away feels like loss. The loss of your favorite toy in a park where you will never return. The loss of your childhood neighborhood when you moved and had to make all new friends and an all new identity in an all new place– never ever quite feeling like you fit in the same way you did in your old home. An important loss, but something that will fade with time. A loss that will hit you years later in ways you can’t put into words.
