You reach out to the concrete on either side to slow the boat, and easily clamber out. The boat continues down the stream without you. 

You immediately feel tired as you overlook the two mannequins. You decide to join the mannequin on the floor and sit down beside it. 

Your limbs feel stiff, and stretching does not relieve this feeling. Your skin catches the light as you stretch. It’s shiny. In fact, it looks just like varnished wood. You rap your knuckles against the shiny spot on your skin, and it sounds just like two pieces of varnished wood being clunked together. 

You don’t have much time to worry about this development, because the exhaustion is really taking hold now. You’re so tired your limbs are wooden, both literally and figuratively. A bit of a nap here couldn’t hurt.
