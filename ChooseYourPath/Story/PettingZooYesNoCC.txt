You step through the wooden gate onto the hard packed dirt. You kick up dust as you walk towards the bright white enclosure. When you touch the door to step inside, it is skin-warm, like the enclosure itself has blood pumping just beneath the fresh coats of paint. 

Inside is filled with sweet-smelling clean hay. A single animal is curled up atop the hay, a small brown fawn with bright white spots. You’ve woken it up. It lifts its head to gaze at you and bleats a greeting—or is it a question? 

Yes, it’s a question. 

You fall to your knees as the words of a god fill your brain. 

HAVE YOU AN OFFERING, OR HAVE YOU DISTURBED MY SLUMBER WITHOUT REASON?

An offering? Do you have anything on you that you can offer the fawn? You search your pockets frantically.

All you have is the park map and your ticket. These aren’t going to be enough. 

You have nothing to offer the little fawn, and so you shake your head. 

The fawn stands in a slow unfurling that reminds you more of a spider than any mammal you’ve seen. It has too many legs, and those legs are too long, with too many joints. It flicks its ears, and you fully collapse on the ground before it. 

You hear the gentle rustling of hay as the fawn approaches your prone form. 

You hear the crunch seconds before your body allows you to feel the white hot pain, shooting up your arm and filling your entire body. 

It’s a small blessing that you cannot see the gore of what the fawn is doing to your body, and a far larger blessing that everything goes black before it is finished.
