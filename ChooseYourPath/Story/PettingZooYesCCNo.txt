Surely the caramel corn wouldn’t be enough. Besides, the sign said not to feed the animals!

You have nothing to offer the little fawn, and so you shake your head. 

The fawn stands in a slow unfurling that reminds you more of a spider than any mammal you’ve seen. It has too many legs, and those legs are too long, with too many joints. It flicks its ears, and you fully collapse on the ground before it. 

You hear the gentle rustling of hay as the fawn approaches your prone form. 

You hear the crunch seconds before your body allows you to feel the white hot pain, shooting up your arm and filling your entire body. 

It’s a small blessing that you cannot see the gore of what the fawn is doing to your body, and a far larger blessing that everything goes black before it is finished.
