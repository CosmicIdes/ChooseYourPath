You reach out to the concrete on either side to slow the boat, and easily clamber out. The boat continues down the stream without you. 

The recording immediately sounds clearer now that you’re level with the scene. The performer is beginning the second verse, and the quality of her voice causes you to turn and look at the stage. 

A young woman in a red dress is standing there singing where the mannequin used to be. “If I had only listened to what my mama said, I’d be at home today. But bein’ so young and foolish, my Lord, let a gambler lead me astray.”

“Hey!” The bartender calls to you. He’s finished pouring the drink and is passing it to the man in front of him. “Find a seat or buy a drink, but quit blockin’ the door!” 

And you are blocking the door, aren’t you? You move to the bar past the card players. 

The man who just received his drink is eyeing you. “You okay there, pardner? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

You suppose the best thing to do is order a drink, and you do, before turning to the man who spoke and beginning to tell him all about the strange day you’ve been having.
