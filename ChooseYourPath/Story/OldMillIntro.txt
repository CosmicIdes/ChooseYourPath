The Old Mill Ride has all the appearances of literally being in an old mill, a large wooden structure with a water wheel on the outside being pushed along by a not insignificant stream. There is an opening under the structure that lets the stream flow under and presumably through it. 

There is none of the expected queue area that similar rides possess, just an yawning empty doorway to darkness. The only indication that this is indeed an attraction at a theme park is a very old paint job on the side of the building.

“YE OLDE MILL” is painted in overwrought imitation medieval text across the aged wood.

You enter through the wide doorway. It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the gloom inside, despite the rest of the park not being particularly bright. 

The room is empty save for an extremely old man. He wears a faded polo shirt with a nametag that reads “Gene.” He looks tired, and greets you only with a slight wave of his hand. His sallow skin is the color of yellowed receipts. 

He is standing by the stream, which is flanked on both sides by a poured concrete floor. A small boat waits by him, its movement down the stream hampered by a bar that must be manually lifted to let it continue into the depths of the ride. 

“I miss my brother,” Gene confides to you as you approach, his voice bearing all the weight of his years. “I’m so confused now. Ray always knew what to do. I feel like I’m just going in circles.” He gestures to the boat and sighs. “Climb in.”

Will you ride the Old Mill?
