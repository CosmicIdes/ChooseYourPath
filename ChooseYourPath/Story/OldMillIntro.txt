The Old Mill Ride has all the appearances of literally being in an old mill, a large wooden structure with a water wheel on the outside being pushed along by a not insignificant stream. There is an opening under the structure that lets the stream flow under and presumably through it. 

There is none of the expected queue area that similar rides possess, just an yawning empty doorway to darkness. The only indication that this is indeed an attraction at a theme park is a very old paint job on the side of the building.

“YE OLDE MILL” is painted in overwrought imitation medieval text across the aged wood.

The air around you feels electric as you stare at the old building. This place is full of possibilities both exciting and terrifying.

Will you enter the Old Mill Ride?
