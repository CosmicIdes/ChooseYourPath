With trembling hands, you pull the small, dusty box of caramel corn from your pocket and hold it out to the little fawn. 

The fawn stands in a slow unfurling that reminds you more of a spider than any mammal you’ve seen. It has too many legs, and those legs are too long, with too many joints. It flicks its ears, and you fully collapse on the ground before it. 

You hear the gentle rustling of hay as the fawn approaches your prone form. 

A soft crunch near your ear as it eats some of the spilled caramel corn. More rustling, and you realize it’s gently snuffling the inside of the box as it eats more. 

You wake up outside the enclosure. In your pocket is a green rock with an image of an eight-legged stag engraved upon it, and your caramel corn is gone.
