You reach out to the concrete on either side to slow the boat, and easily clamber out. The boat continues down the stream without you. 

This scene is particularly poorly made. From the boat you could make out the corrugated sides of the gravestones, and here among the graves it’s even more obvious that they are just painted cardboard. 

The forest backdrop is more intriguing, as it is painted skillfully by someone who really should be painting for somewhere other than Hill Cavern Fair. You can make out individual plants and trees, and– there is some animal in the forest, watching you. 

You are drawn to that spot on the backdrop, heading forward to look closer. By the time you realize something is wrong, you’re already in the forest.

A stag stands before you, twice your height and with twice as many legs as it should have. Its antlers are tall and many-branched, extending up into the trees where you are unable to see them end. Its eyes glow without any light source to reflect back.

Its voice fills your mind. 

I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, SERVANT. FOLLOW ME.

You have no choice but to follow the creature as it leads you deeper into the forest.
