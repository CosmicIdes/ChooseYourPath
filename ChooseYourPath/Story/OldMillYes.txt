It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the gloom inside, despite the rest of the park not being particularly bright. 

The room is empty save for an extremely old man. He wears a faded polo shirt with a nametag that reads “Gene.” He looks tired, and greets you only with a slight wave of his hand. His sallow skin is the color of yellowed receipts. 

He is standing by the stream, which is held in by a poured concrete floor. A small boat waits by him, its movement down the stream hampered by a bar that must be manually lifted to let it continue into the depths of the ride. 

“I miss my brother,” Gene confides to you as you approach, his voice bearing all the weight of his years. “I’m so confused now. Ray always knew what to do. I feel like I’m just going in circles.” He gestures to the boat and sighs. “Climb in.”

Type “Ride” to climb into the boat, or “Park Map” to select a different attraction.
