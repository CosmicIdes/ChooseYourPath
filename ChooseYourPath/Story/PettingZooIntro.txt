The petting zoo seemed like a safe choice, but as you approach it now you’re filled with the same dread you felt making the decision to come inside Hill Cavern Fair. The Petting Zoo has no attendant, and no animals in sight. A cheery hand painted sign hangs lopsided by one nail over the entrance.

HILL CAVERN PETTING ZOO

The entire area is surrounded by a wooden fence, and the surrounding forest, despite its enthusiasm for the other buildings in this park, does not encroach beyond it. The ground is dry and dusty, with none of the animal droppings found at similar petting zoos across the world. 

On the far side of the animal enclosure is a small building– you assume a shelter for the animals– in surprisingly pristine condition. It looks like it has recently been painted, or maybe even recently built. It’s solid white and has a similarly hand painted sign. 

PLEASE— DON’T FEED THE ANIMALS! 
THANK YOU, MGMT

There are of course no animals in sight, only an empty enclosure with a foreboding air that twists your stomach. Something is very, very wrong here, more wrong than the cumulative wrongness of the rest of Hill Cavern Fair.

Will you explore further?
