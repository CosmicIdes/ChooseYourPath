You head down the cracked asphalt path in the direction the map promises a snack stand. You’re unsure if a place like this is somewhere you would like to actually eat food, but curiosity leads you on to the little booth tucked into a mass of trees and vines that seem only days from swallowing the building entirely. The vines are so thick along the cracked and aged wood that you wonder how an employee could get inside the building. Flecks of paint hint that at one time this shack was brightly colored, but now exposed gray wood and rusted nails are its defining features.

You’re sure this place is completely closed until you catch sight of the extremely improbable man behind the counter. 

An old man with skin the color of yellowed receipts is hunched over an equally ancient cash register. His name tag reads “Gene.” To his left, a hand painted, chipped sign advertises the wares of the Snack Stand. 

SLUSHEE — 30¢
CARAMEL CORN — 25¢
COTTON CANDY — 15¢

Before you can ask if the prices are a joke, the man says, “The slushees are new. Added ‘em only a little while ago. They’re cherry flavored.” He puffs himself up, standing at his full height, which is still shorter than you. 

“What’ll it be?”
